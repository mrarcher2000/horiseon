#Horiseon Online Marketing

##Description

Horiseon is a mock Online Marketing agency that specializes in Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. This project was built based off of a mock-up to meet accessibility guidelines as a lead generation tool for the company. 

The overarching purpose of this website is to showcase my own personal abilities with HTML and CSS. The webpage was refactored to meet accessibility guidelines and optimize the traffic the website recieves via search engines. Links were fixed to ensure that the navigation on the webpage was working smoothly and semantic elements were added to ensure that screen readers and other accessibility devices could navigate the page smoothly as well. Alternative texts were added for images on the site. 

The project is can be deployed [here](https://https://mrarcher2000.github.io/horiseon/) or at https://mrarcher2000.github.io/horiseon/ .
